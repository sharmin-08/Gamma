# Trapezoidal Rule for Numerical Integrationgit

## Overview

This project provides a C++ implementation of the Trapezoidal Rule for approximating the definite integral of a function. The program calculates the integral of the Gaussian function, f(x) = e^(-x^2) from 0 to 1. This project serves as a clear and practical demonstration of numerical integration principles.

## Objectives

-   To apply the numerical method of the trapezoidal rule to a specific function.
-   To show how increasing the number of subintervals (`n`) improves the accuracy of the approximation.
